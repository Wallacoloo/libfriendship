It would be beneficial if we could remove the "delay" and "freq shift" effects
and emulate them via pure amplitude modulation.

For amplitude modulation, we have an input stream + 2d automation.
Each individual frequency component of the input stream is multiplied by f(w,
t), where w is the input frequency and t is time.

This easily allows for both amplitude modulation (f(w, t) is constant for a
given w) AND frequency shifting (f(w, t) = e^(w_0 t)), at least discretely.

Questions:
  (1) Can it also allow for *non*-discrete pitch shifting (e.g. double
each frequency, rather than add a constant w_0 to the frequency)?
  (2) Can it emulate delays?
    (2.a) Different delay for each frequency?
    (2.b) Delay is a function of time?


Based on the pitch-shift prototype, in which pitch shifting was achieved
through linearly interpolating discrete pitches, (1) would appear to be
possible.


Although for (2), a signal can easily be gated off/on at a specific time (thus
allowing one to delay a signal), the gate time needs to be relative to the
start time of the signal.


It *is* possible that we add a third parameter to the amplitude modulation:
f(w, t0, t). In that case, the gate time could at least *theoretically* be
made relative to the start time of the signal.
